Netflix Clone:

During my web development internship at Bharat Intern Company, I delved into an exciting project I named the "Netflix Clone." This endeavor aimed to replicate the essence of Netflix using HTML and CSS, essentially creating a mirror image of the renowned streaming platform.

Through meticulous coding and design, I crafted a user interface that closely emulated Netflix's layout and functionalities. Users could navigate through a curated content catalog, similar to the original platform, allowing them to browse, search, and select movies or TV shows seamlessly.

The project demanded a deep dive into HTML and CSS, where I meticulously crafted the visual elements and layout to mimic Netflix's aesthetic. This involved attention to detail, ensuring the interface captured the essence of the original platform while also maintaining responsiveness across various devices.

While my project specifically focused on the front-end using HTML and CSS, it provided a solid foundation for future enhancements or integration with back-end technologies. This experience highlighted my ability to replicate complex interfaces and provided a hands-on learning opportunity in web development.

Overall, the Netflix Clone project was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It allowed me to showcase my proficiency in HTML and CSS, demonstrating my dedication to creating a user interface that closely resembled a widely recognized platform like Netflix.
